Headphones Buying Guide

1. Types

2. Key Features
- ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) is essential for flights, commuting, or noisy offices.
- Transparency mode is useful for safety outdoors.
- Multipoint connection helps switch between laptop and phone seamlessly.

3. Battery Life
- Aim for 30+ hours on over-ear, 7+ hours on earbuds.
- Fast charging (10 mins = few hours playback) is a big plus.

4. Audio Quality
- Look for codecs: LDAC, aptX Adaptive for hi-res streaming.
- Drivers size matters less than tuning; reviews matter more.
