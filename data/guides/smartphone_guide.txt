Smartphone Buying Guide (2025)

1. RAM & Performance
- For smooth multitasking, aim for at least 8 GB RAM.
- Gamers may prefer 12 GB or more with fast processors (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Apple A-series).
- More RAM helps future-proof the device.

2. Storage
- 128 GB is comfortable for most users.
- 256 GB+ if you shoot a lot of videos or play heavy games.
- Prefer UFS 3.1 or higher for faster speeds.

3. Display
- AMOLED > LCD for richer colors and deeper blacks.
- 120Hz refresh rate is now common; 90Hz is minimum for smoother scrolling.
- High brightness (1000+ nits) helps outdoors.

4. Battery & Charging
- 5000 mAh batteries last a full day with heavy use.
- Fast charging (30W, 65W, 100W) is key â€” check bundled charger availability.
- Wireless charging is convenient but slower.

5. Cameras
- Ignore megapixels alone; look for sensor size and OIS.
- Dual or triple setups with ultrawide and telephoto are more versatile.

6. 5G & Connectivity
- Ensure support for popular 5G bands in your region.
- Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 improve experience.

7. Brand Ecosystem
- iOS (Apple) vs Android: Apple gives longer software support; Android is more flexible.
- Consider ecosystem lock-in if you own wearables, tablets, or laptops.
